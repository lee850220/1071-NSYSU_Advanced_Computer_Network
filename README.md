This is the homework of the course.

## Part 1
Web Browsing (DNS, TCP) \

Objective \
In this exercise we analyze the layered structure of network protocols using a web browsing example. We examine the header structure of the PDUs at the data link, IP, transport, and application layers. In particular we observe how addresses and port numbers work together to enable end-to-end applications.
